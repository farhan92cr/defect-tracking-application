Great to hear that the code has been successfully deployed! Let's break down the workflow and understand how it functions, step by step. I'll explain the CI/CD process and how each part of the code interacts with GitHub and your Vultr server.

What is CI/CD?
CI (Continuous Integration): This involves automatically testing and integrating code changes as they are pushed to a repository. It ensures that new changes don't break the existing codebase.

CD (Continuous Deployment): This extends CI by automatically deploying the integrated code to production or staging environments, ensuring that the application is always in a releasable state.

Is This Code CI or Both CI/CD?
This code is both CI and CD. It integrates changes when code is pushed to the repository (CI) and then deploys those changes to your Vultr server (CD).
Breakdown of the Workflow
Here's an example workflow configuration in GitHub Actions for deploying a Flask app:

name: CI/CD Pipeline for Flask App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up SSH
      uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.8.1
      with:
        ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}

    - name: Deploy to Vultr server
      env:
        SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
        SERVER_IP: ${{ secrets.SERVER_IP }}
        SERVER_USER: ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }}
      run: |
        echo "$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY" > private_key
        chmod 600 private_key
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i private_key $SERVER_USER@$SERVER_IP <<EOF
          cd /var/www/defect-tracking-application/
          git pull origin main
          sudo systemctl restart flask
        EOF
        rm private_key
Step-by-Step Explanation
Workflow Name:


name: CI/CD Pipeline for Flask App
This defines the name of the workflow, which will appear under the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.
Trigger (on: push):


on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
What it does: This trigger runs the workflow every time a commit is pushed to the main branch.
Why it's important: Ensures that any changes pushed to the main branch automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
Job Definition (jobs: deploy):


jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
What it does: This defines a job named deploy that runs on the latest Ubuntu virtual machine provided by GitHub Actions.
Why it's important: The job runs on a GitHub-hosted runner (a virtual machine), which executes the steps defined in the job.
Step 1 - Checkout Code:


- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
What it does: This step checks out (downloads) your repository's code onto the runner.
Why it's important: The runner needs access to the repository's code to execute the deployment.
Step 2 - Set up SSH:


- name: Set up SSH
  uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.8.1
  with:
    ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
What it does: This step sets up SSH access using the private key stored in GitHub Secrets. The ssh-agent is started, and the private key is added so that subsequent SSH commands can authenticate using this key.
Why it's important: Securely connects to your Vultr server to deploy the code.
Step 3 - Deploy to Vultr Server:


- name: Deploy to Vultr server
  env:
    SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
    SERVER_IP: ${{ secrets.SERVER_IP }}
    SERVER_USER: ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }}
  run: |
    echo "$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY" > private_key
    chmod 600 private_key
    ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i private_key $SERVER_USER@$SERVER_IP <<EOF
      cd /var/www/defect-tracking-application/
      git pull origin main
      sudo systemctl restart flask
    EOF
    rm private_key
What it does:
SSH Setup: It stores the SSH private key in a file called private_key and sets the correct permissions.
SSH Connection: Connects to the Vultr server via SSH using the provided SERVER_USER and SERVER_IP.
Deployment Commands:
Navigates to the directory where your Flask app is located.
Pulls the latest code from the main branch.
Restarts the Flask service using systemctl.
Cleanup: Removes the private_key file after the deployment.
Why it's important: This step is the heart of the deployment process, where the code is actually updated on your Vultr server and the Flask application is restarted.
What Happens on Each Machine?
GitHub Actions Runner (Virtual Machine):

The runner is where the CI/CD pipeline starts. It checks out the code, sets up SSH, and then uses SSH to connect to your Vultr server.
Vultr Server:

Your Flask application is hosted here. The deployment commands executed via SSH pull the latest code and restart the Flask service, ensuring that your application is always running the most recent version.
Summary
CI: The pipeline ensures your code is integrated by pulling the latest changes from GitHub.
CD: It automatically deploys these changes to your Vultr server.
This pipeline helps automate the deployment process, reducing the chances of human error and ensuring that your application is consistently updated with the latest changes.



the installation using pip in the "Install dependencies" step is not done on your Vultr server. It is done on the GitHub Actions runner, which is a separate environment provided by GitHub.

Here's a breakdown of where each step occurs:

GitHub Actions Runner
Location: The runner is a virtual machine provided by GitHub that executes your workflow jobs.
Actions Taken:
Checkout code: Downloads your repository's code onto the runner.
Set up Python: Installs the specified Python version on the runner.
Install dependencies: Installs the Python packages required for your application on the runner. This includes updating pip and installing packages from requirements.txt.
Run tests: (If you have tests) Executes any tests you specify to verify your code.
Vultr Server
Location: Your production or staging server where your Flask app is hosted.
Actions Taken:
Deploy to Vultr server: This step connects to your Vultr server via SSH and performs actions like pulling the latest code and restarting the Flask service. This is where the application code is updated and the service is restarted.
Summary
Dependency Installation: The installation of Python dependencies using pip happens on the GitHub Actions runner.
Deployment: The deployment actions (like pulling the latest code and restarting the Flask service) happen on your Vultr server.
So, the pip installations are not performed on the Vultr server; rather, they prepare your code on the GitHub Actions runner, and then the updated code is deployed to your Vultr server where it runs.
